# MD-GPT
## Introduction
MD-GPT is a web-based application that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize patient diagnosis and consultation management. It is developed using NextJS, MongoDB, FastAPI, and OpenAI’s Python library.

## Features
MD-GPT empowers medical professionals, particularly doctors, to enhance their diagnostic capabilities and streamline patient interactions. It encompasses an array of sophisticated features, including:

- A robust system for patient and consultation management, allowing doctors to effortlessly create, update, retrieve, and delete patient records.
- An AI-powered chat interface that enables doctors to engage with an AI model meticulously trained on a vast corpus of doctor-patient conversations. This AI model, attuned to medical terminology and patient histories, provides invaluable insights to assist in the diagnostic process.
- Natural language processing (NLP) capability through OpenAI’s Python library, allowing it to analyze conversations between healthcare professionals and patients. This NLP capability extracts critical information, interprets symptoms, and offers potential diagnoses based on the available data.
- A secure and scalable MongoDB database to ensure data integrity and privacy. This database seamlessly stores patient profiles, consultation histories, and chat transcripts, facilitating efficient data management.
## Setup
